        <li>Ambedkar was born on 14 April 1891 in the town and military cantonment of Mhow (now officially known as Dr
            Ambedkar Nagar) (now in Madhya Pradesh).[3] He was the 14th and last child of Ramji Maloji Sakpal, an army
            officer who held the rank of Subedar, and Bhimabai Sakpal, daughter of Laxman Murbadkar.[4] His family was
            of Marathi background from the town of Ambadawe (Mandangad taluka) in Ratnagiri district of modern-day
            Maharashtra. Ambedkar was born into a Mahar (dalit) caste, who were treated as untouchables and subjected to
            socio-economic discrimination.[5] Ambedkar's ancestors had long worked for the army of the British East
            India Company, and his father served in the British Indian Army at the Mhow cantonment.[6] Although they
            attended school, Ambedkar and other untouchable children were segregated and given little attention or help
            by teachers. They were not allowed to sit inside the class. When they needed to drink water, someone from a
            higher caste had to pour that water from a height as they were not allowed to touch either the water or the
            vessel that contained it. This task was usually performed for the young Ambedkar by the school peon, and if
            the peon was not available then he had to go without water; he described the situation later in his writings
            as "No peon, No Water".[7] He was required to sit on a gunny sack which he had to take home with him.[8]

        <br>
        <li> Ramji Sakpal retired in 1894 and the family moved to Satara two years later. Shortly after their move,
            Ambedkar's mother died. The children were cared for by their paternal aunt and lived in difficult
            circumstances. Three sons – Balaram, Anandrao and Bhimrao – and two daughters – Manjula and Tulasa – of the
            Ambedkars survived them. Of his brothers and sisters, only Ambedkar passed his examinations and went to high
            school. His original surname was Sakpal but his father registered his name as Ambadawekar in school, meaning
            he comes from his native village 'Ambadawe' in Ratnagiri district.[9][10][11][12] His Marathi Brahmin
            teacher, Krishnaji Keshav Ambedkar, changed his surname from 'Ambadawekar' to his own surname 'Ambedkar' in
            school records.</li>

        <li>n 1897, Ambedkar's family moved to Mumbai where Ambedkar became the only untouchable enrolled at Elphinstone
            High School. In 1906, when he was about 15 years old, he married a nine-year-old girl, Ramabai. The match
            was arranged by the couple's parents, in accordance with prevailing custom at that time.</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>In 1907, he passed his matriculation examination and in the following year he entered Elphinstone College,
            which was affiliated to the University of Bombay, becoming, according to him, the first from his Mahar caste
            to do so. When he passed his English fourth standard examinations, the people of his community wanted to
            celebrate because they considered that he had reached "great heights" which he says was "hardly an occasion
            compared to the state of education in other communities"</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>A public ceremony was evoked, to celebrate his success, by the community, and it was at this occasion that
            he was presented with a biography of the Buddha by Dada Keluskar, the author and a family friend.[19]

            By 1912, he obtained his degree in economics and political science from Bombay University, and prepared to
            take up employment with the Baroda state government. His wife had just moved his young family and started
            work when he had to quickly return to Mumbai to see his ailing father, who died on 2 February 1913.[20]</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>In 1913, at the age of 22, Ambedkar was awarded a Baroda State Scholarship of £11.50 (Sterling) per month
            for three years under a scheme established by Sayajirao Gaekwad III (Gaekwad of Baroda) that was designed to
            provide opportunities for postgraduate education at Columbia University in New York City. Soon after
            arriving there he settled in rooms at Livingston Hall with Naval Bhathena, a Parsi who was to be a lifelong
            friend. He passed his M.A. exam in June 1915, majoring in economics, and other subjects of Sociology,
            History, Philosophy and Anthropology. He presented a thesis, Ancient Indian Commerce. Ambedkar was
            influenced by John Dewey and his work on democracy.[21] In 1916, he completed his second master's thesis,
            National Dividend of India – A Historic and Analytical Study, for a second M.A.[22] On 9 May, he presented
            the paper Castes in India: Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development before a seminar conducted by the
            anthropologist Alexander Goldenweiser. Ambedkar received his Ph.D. degree in economics at Columbia in 1927.[

        <br>
        <br>
        <li>In October 1916, he enrolled for the Bar course at Gray's Inn, and at the same time enrolled at the London
            School of Economics where he started working on a doctoral thesis. In June 1917, he returned to India
            because his scholarship from Baroda ended. His book collection was dispatched on a different ship from the
            one he was on, and that ship was torpedoed and sunk by a German submarine.[20] He got permission to return
            to London to submit his thesis within four years. He returned at the first opportunity, and completed a
            master's degree in 1921. His thesis was on "The problem of the rupee: Its origin and its solution".[23] In
            1923, he completed a D.Sc. in Economics which was awarded from University of London, and the same year he
            was called to the Bar by Gray's Inn.[1]

        <li>As Ambedkar was educated by the Princely State of Baroda, he was bound to serve it. He was appointed
            Military Secretary to the Gaikwad but had to quit in a short time. He described the incident in his
            autobiography, Waiting for a Visa.[24] Thereafter, he tried to find ways to make a living for his growing
            family. He worked as a private tutor, as an accountant, and established an investment consulting business,
            but it failed when his clients learned that he was an untouchable.[25] In 1918, he became professor of
            political economy in the Sydenham College of Commerce and Economics in Mumbai. Although he was successful
            with the students, other professors objected to his sharing a drinking-water jug with them.[26]</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>Ambedkar had been invited to testify before the Southborough Committee, which was preparing the Government
            of India Act 1919. At this hearing, Ambedkar argued for creating separate electorates and reservations for
            untouchables and other religious communities.[27] In 1920, he began the publication of the weekly Mooknayak
            (Leader of the Silent) in Mumbai with the help of Shahu of Kolhapur, that is, Shahu IV (1874–1922).[28]

        </li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>Ambedkar went on to work as a legal professional. In 1926, he successfully defended three non-Brahmin
            leaders who had accused the Brahmin community of ruining India and were then subsequently sued for libel.
            Dhananjay Keer notes, "The victory was resounding, both socially and individually, for the clients and the
            doctor".[29]</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>While practising law in the Bombay High Court, he tried to promote education to untouchables and uplift
            them. His first organised attempt was his establishment of the central institution Bahishkrit Hitakarini
            Sabha, intended to promote education and socio-economic improvement, as well as the welfare of "outcastes",
            at the time referred to as depressed classes.[30] For the defence of Dalit rights, he started many
            periodicals like Mook Nayak, Bahishkrit Bharat, and Equality Janta.[31]</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>He was appointed to the Bombay Presidency Committee to work with the all-European Simon Commission in
            1925.[32] This commission had sparked great protests across India, and while its report was ignored by most
            Indians, Ambedkar himself wrote a separate set of recommendations for the future Constitution of India.[33]

        </li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>By 1927, Ambedkar had decided to launch active movements against untouchability. He began with public
            movements and marches to open up public drinking water resources. He also began a struggle for the right to
            enter Hindu temples. He led a satyagraha in Mahad to fight for the right of the untouchable community to
            draw water from the main water tank of the town.[34] In a conference in late 1927, Ambedkar publicly
            condemned the classic Hindu text, the Manusmriti (Laws of Manu), for ideologically justifying caste
            discrimination and "untouchability", and he ceremonially burned copies of the ancient text. On 25 December
            1927, he led thousands of followers to burn copies of Manusmriti.[35][36] Thus annually 25 December is
            celebrated as Manusmriti Dahan Din (Manusmriti Burning Day) by Ambedkarites and Dalits.[37][38]</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>In 1930, Ambedkar launched the Kalaram Temple movement after three months of preparation. About 15,000
            volunteers assembled at Kalaram Temple satygraha making one of the greatest processions of Nashik. The
            procession was headed by a military band and a batch of scouts; women and men walked with discipline, order
            and determination to see the god for the first time. When they reached the gates, the gates were closed by
            Brahmin authorities.[</li>

        <li>n 1932, the British colonial government announced the formation of a separate electorate for "Depressed
            Classes" in the Communal Award. Mahatma Gandhi fiercely opposed a separate electorate for untouchables,
            saying he feared that such an arrangement would divide the Hindu community.[40][41][42] Gandhi protested by
            fasting while imprisoned in the Yerwada Central Jail of Poona. Following the fast, congressional politicians
            and activists such as Madan Mohan Malaviya and Palwankar Baloo organised joint meetings with Ambedkar and
            his supporters at Yerwada.[4</li>
