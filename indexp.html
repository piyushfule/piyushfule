            <br>
            <p1>Virat Kohli (Hindi pronunciation: [ʋɪˈɾɑːʈ ˈkoːɦli] ⓘ; born 5 November 1988) is an Indian
                international
                cricketer and the former captain of the Indian national cricket team. He is a right-handed batsman and
                an
                occasional medium-fast bowler. He currently represents Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the IPL and Delhi
                in
                domestic cricket. Kohli is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time.[3] He holds the
                record as
                the highest run-scorer in T20I and IPL, ranks third in ODI, and stands as the fourth-highest in
                international
                cricket.[4] He also holds the record for scoring the most centuries in ODI cricket and stands second in
                the list
                of most international centuries scored. Kohli was a member of the Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket
                World
                Cup, 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, and captained India to win the ICC Test mace three consecutive times in
                2017,
                2018, and 2019.[5]

                In 2013, Kohli was ranked number one in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen. In 2015, he achieved the
                summit of
                T20I rankings.[6] In 2018, he was ranked top Test batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer to hold
                the
                number one spot in all three formats of the game. He is the first player to score 20,000 runs in a
                decade. In
                2020, the International Cricket Council named him the male cricketer of the decade.[7]

                He has received many accolades for his performances in cricket. He won the ICC ODI Player of the Year
                award four
                times in 2012, 2017, 2018, and 2023. He also won the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy, given to the ICC
                Cricketer of
                the Year, on two occasions, in 2017 and 2018 respectively. In 2018, he became the first player to win
                both ICC
                ODI and Test Player of the Year awards in the same year. Also, he was named the Wisden Leading Cricketer
                in the
                World for three consecutive years, from 2016 to 2018. At the national level, Kohli was honoured with the
                Arjuna
                Award in 2013, the Padma Shri in 2017, and India's highest sporting honour, the Khel Ratna award, in
                2018.

                In 2018, Time magazine included him on its list of the 100 most influential people in the world. Kohli
                has been
                deemed one of the most commercially viable athletes, with estimated earnings of ₹634 crore (US$79
                million) in
                the year 2022.

                Early life
                Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem Nath
                Kohli,
                worked as a criminal lawyer, and his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older
                brother, Vikas,
                and an older sister, Bhawna.[8] Kohli's formative years were spent in Uttam Nagar. He commenced his
                early
                education at Vishal Bharti Public School.[9] According to his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity
                for
                cricket as a mere three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket bat, display natural skill, and request his
                father
                to bowl to him.[10]

                In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WDCA) was created. On 30 May of that year, Prem Kohli, who'd
                espoused
                his younger son's fervour for cricket, assisted nine-year-old Kohli's aspirations and arranged for him
                to meet
                Rajkumar Sharma.[11] Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's father considered enrolling his
                son in a
                professional cricket academy, as they believed that his cricketing abilities merited more than just
                playing in
                gully cricket.[12] Despite his abilities, he faced the setback of being unable to secure a place in the
                under-14
                Delhi team, supposedly due to extraneous factors. Prem Kohli reportedly received offers to relocate his
                son to
                influential clubs, which would have ensured his selection, but he declined the proposals. Kohli
                eventually found
                his way into the under-15 Delhi team.[13] He received training at the academy while simultaneously
                participating
                in matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy located at Vasundhara Enclave.[14] In pursuit of furthering his
                cricketing career, he transitioned to Saviour Convent School during his ninth-grade education.[12]

                On 18 December 2006, Kohli experienced the loss of his father due to a cerebral attack.[12][15] During
                his
                childhood, his father played a crucial role in supporting his cricket training. Kohli has credited his
                father as
                the one who drove him to practice every day. He has expressed his feelings of missing his father's
                presence at
                times.[9][16] According to his mother, Kohli's demeanour shifted noticeably after his father's death. He
                took
                cricket with newfound seriousness, prioritizing playing time and dedicating himself fully to the
                sport.[12]
                Kohli's family resided in Meera Bagh, Paschim Vihar until the year 2015, after which they relocated to
                Gurgaon.[17]</p1>

        <p1>Rohit Gurunath Sharma (born 30 April 1987) is an Indian international cricketer who
            currently captains
            the
            India national cricket team across all formats. He is a right-handed batsman. Considered one of the best
            batsmen of his generation and one of the greatest opening batters of all time,[3] Sharma is known for his
            timing, elegance, six-hitting abilities and leadership skills. Sharma holds several batting records which
            famously include most sixes in international cricket,[a] most double centuries in ODI cricket (3), most
            centuries at Cricket World Cups (7) and joint most hundreds in Twenty20 Internationals (5). Rohit Sharma is
            the first player to score 5 T20I centuries.[5] He plays for Mumbai Indians in IPL and for Mumbai in domestic
            cricket.

            Sharma formerly captained Mumbai Indians and the team has won 5 titles in 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2020
            under his leadership, making him the most successful captain in IPL history, sharing this record with MS
            Dhoni (5 title wins in IPL). With India, Sharma was a member of the team that won the 2007 T20 World Cup,
            and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, where he played in the finals of both tournaments. Rohit is one of four
            players to have played in every edition of the ICC T20 World Cup, from the inaugural edition in 2007 to the
            latest one in 2022.

            Sharma currently holds the world record for the highest individual score (264) in a One Day International
            (ODI) match and is the only player to have scored three double-centuries in ODIs and also holds the record
            for scoring most hundreds (five) in a single Cricket World Cup, for which he won the ICC Men's ODI Cricketer
            of the Year award in 2019. Sharma has received two national honours, the Arjuna Award in 2015 and the
            prestigious Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award in 2020 by the Government of India. Under his captaincy,
            India won the 2018 Asia Cup and the 2023 Asia Cup, the seventh and eighth time the country won the title,
            both in ODI format as well as the 2018 Nidahas Trophy, their second overall and first in T20I format.

            Outside cricket, Sharma is an active supporter of animal welfare campaigns. He is the official Rhino
            Ambassador for WWF-India and is a member of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). He has
            worked with PETA in its campaign to raise awareness of the plight of homeless cats and dogs in India.

            Early life
            Sharma was born on 30 April 1987 in Bansod, Nagpur, Maharashtra, India.[6] His mother, Purnima Sharma, is
            from Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh.[7] His father, Gurunath Sharma, worked as a caretaker of a transport
            firm storehouse. Sharma was raised by his grandparents and uncles in Borivali because of his father's low
            income. He would visit his parents, who lived in a single-room house in Dombivli, only during weekends.[8]
            He has a younger brother, Vishal Sharma.[9] His mother tongue is Telugu.

            Sharma joined a cricket camp in 1999 with his uncle's money. Dinesh Lad, his coach at the camp, asked him to
            change his school to Swami Vivekanand International School, where Lad was the coach and the cricket
            facilities were better than those at Sharma's old school. Sharma recollects, "I told him I couldn't afford
            it, but he got me a scholarship. So for four years I didn't pay a penny, and did well in my cricket".[9]
            Sharma started as an off-spinner who could bat a bit before Lad noticed his batting ability and promoted him
            from number eight to open the innings. He excelled in the Harris and Giles Shield school cricket
            tournaments, scoring a century on debut as an opener.[10]

        <p>Jasprit Jasbirsingh Bumrah (born 6 December 1993) is an Indian international cricketer who plays for the
            Indian cricket team in all formats of the game. A right-arm fast bowler with a unique bowling action, Bumrah
            is widely regarded as one of the best bowlers in the world and as one of the greatest fast bowlers India has
            ever produced.[4] He plays for Gujarat in domestic cricket and for Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier
            League (IPL).

            Bumrah is the fastest Indian pacer to take 150 wickets in Test cricket and the second fastest Indian bowler
            to reach 100 wickets in One-Day International cricket. He also holds the record of scoring the highest runs
            in an over in Test cricket. As of March 2024, he is the highest-ranked bowler in the ICC Test player
            rankings and the first bowler to achieve the number one ranking in all three formats of the game.

            Bumrah made his domestic debut in 2012–13 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and also helped his side clinch its maiden
            title victory. His first-class debut came against Vidarbha, during the 2013–14 season of the Ranji Trophy.
            Bumrah was signed by the Mumbai Indians (MI) for the 2013 season of the IPL. Since then, he has played for
            MI, contributing to the team's title wins five times. He is the second-highest wicket-taker for MI, behind
            Lasith Malinga, with 145 wickets in 120 matches.

            Bumrah made his international debut in January 2016 during India's tour of Australia, where he emerged as
            the highest wicket-taker of the T20I series. In 2016, he was the highest wicket-taker in a calendar year in
            T20I cricket, with 28 wickets. His Test debut came in 2018 against South Africa. Since December 2023, he has
            served as the vice-captain of the Indian team in Test cricket and has also captained the team once in the
            absence of regular skipper Rohit Sharma. He has been named in the ICC Men's Test Team of the Year in 2018
            and has also been named to the ICC Men's ODI Team of the Year in 2017 and 2018. Additionally, he was named
            in the ICC Men's T20I Team of the Decade for 2011–2020. He was awarded the Polly Umrigar Award by the BCCI
            twice, in 2018–19 and 2021–22. Also, he was named in the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 2022.
